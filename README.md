# X-Sono

This is a project that was developed jointly with Alexis Baleras. Its aim is to create a new sound management software for military ceremonies at Ecole Polytechnique Paris.

This system was made for students following French ceremonies, this is why some supporting documents as well as in-app buttons may be in French.

## Compiling

This project was written in C++ with Qt for the graphics. It can therefore be compiled as any Qt project either from the terminal or the GUI.

## Usage

After running the program, select the amount of anthems, or personal pieces you wish to play. Then add the paths to each of the music in the provided boxes. 

The letters and symbols in brackets on the buttons represent the keyboard shortcut to pay that specific track.
